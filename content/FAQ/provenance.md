# What is provenance?

Provenance is information about the processes that used and produced
data. 

## Why use it?

Knowing the relationships among computational processes and data
allows us to conduct formal analyses about entire computer pipelines
without having to re-run it. In other words, although having code and
input data permits reproduction, there's is no way of positively
knowing what the software will do without running.
