## Core Values
- Science is a process that is works better when its shared
- Software should not be a barrier to data science
- Computation should be leveraged to make sharing easier
- Tools are best when they have clear utility and simple API

*Purpose*

ProvTools is creating an open process scientific culture through
tools that capture, store and analyze data provenance. 


## Envisioned Future
*Big Goal*

Broad incorporation of provenande collection and utilization across
many scientific disciplines. Fully transparent, end-to-end publication
of scientific research. 50% reduction in the rate of irreproducible
computational studies and code-rot.

*Vision*

The crucial challenge at the frontier of data science is now the
integration of information and the develompment of synthetic
knowledge. The scientific landscape is rapidly developing software for
data collection and analysis. Software creation is no longer just in
the hands of engineers. Tools to aid data science best practices is a
limiting factor to a majority of scientists, especially those with no
formal data science or software engineering training. In the future,
scientific data will be fully shared. Code for data processing and
analysis will also be freely accessible. Data provenance will
facilitate the legibility across studies and disciplines in the
distributed information processing network of formal and informal
investigators. Data and code will not only be more available they will
also be clearer because production of well curated information about
the processes behind them will be aided by automatic meta-data capture
tools. The gains made from this increased efficiency will enable
benefaction across socio-econimic and cultural barriers, inreasing the
the diversity of the community of participants and stakeholders.
